This program reads input from a charcter device where presumably a DCF77
receiver is connected to.
The input is parsed and written to a shared memory segment, where ntp can
pick it up for further timekeeping.

The main motivation was the the builtin parse driver for ntp  could
crash ntp, e.g. when weird bits came in at weird timing in bad receiving
conditions. 

Bug reports and contributions are welcome, esp. for making the code more
portable.

Works with USB Gude expert Mouse Clock II
